# Discord Bot Template
This is a basic discord.js bot template for Bun

All you have to do is clone this repository and run `bun install` to install the dependencies.
After that, get your bot token from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
Then, create a `config.json` file in the root directory of the project and add the following code:
```json
{
    "token": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
}
```

After that, you can run `bun run index.ts` to start the bot.
